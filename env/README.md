## Environment

### 1.GridStaticEnv

- A reinforcement learning environment, like `gym`
- Algorithm: `Q-learning`

### 2. GridSearchEnv

- A planning search envioroment
- Algorithm:
    - `Breath First Search`
    - `Dijkstra Search`
    - `Astar Search`
    

## TODOLIST
- Add `GridDynamicEnv`
- Add more algorithm for reinforcement learning, such as `DQN`
- Add more algorithm for planning search, such as `Dstar`
